                    Lee Min Jun is an American born Korean fashion designer, born in Dallas Tx.
                    With a passion for storytelling and archives, he aims to create
                    meaningful and powerful designs. Lee has been awarded the UAL
                    Postgraduate Scholarship to study a MA Fashion Design Technology
                    Womenswear at Massachusette school of Fashion, UAL. He had always been
                    focused on how cultural heritage can be preserved and endlessly
                    reinterpreted.  He is also very much inspired by youth subcultures
                    and by the dialogue between identity, culture and dress through the
                    time. Passionate about the meaning of dress in relation to culture,
                    his research is grounded in sociology, fashion, anthropology,
                    folklore and history.  His multi-cultural background is a key point
                    in his creative development. He often uses menswear as an
                    inspiration and likes the idea of men wearing smart clothes. His
                    collections constantly incorporate historical archives, allied with
                    modern elements and inspiring characters. In the final year of the
                    BA course Lee was entered into two national American Fashion
                    Council run competitions, one a research-based design project in
                    conjunction with the British Library and Designer Nabil Nayal; the
                    other with Givenchy's Artistic Director Clare Waight Keller, where
                    his muse was Lou Doillon, singer, songwriter, actress, artist and
                    model with a fascination for the artworks of Egon Schiele. Lee
                    was a finalist in both National competitions resulting in networking
                    opportunities with the British Fashion Council, British Library, and
                    Givenchy teams.
